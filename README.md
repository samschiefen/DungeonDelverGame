# Dungeon Delver
This action-adventure game follows an adventurer named Dray as they explore a dungeon, fight Skeletos and Spiker enemies, and find a Grappler (grappling hook). 
This project is the last prototype developed in the book: *Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development: From Concept to Playable Game with Unity and C# 3rd Edition by Jeremy Gibson Bond*.
To expand upon the protoype tutorial, I added multiple features of my own. The first is the Spiker enemy, which will search for Dray once they enter the room and attack if they are in the specified range. The second is the ability to dodge by clicking space and a direction key. Dray will jump in the direction of the direction key clicked. If Dray is moving upwards, and space and the left direction key are clicked at the same time, Dray will jump to the left. The third is a flag which, once collected, will take you to the next map. There are currently 2 maps included, as well as a start and end screen. Once the final flag is collected, you will be directed to the end screen. I also added a death feature, where if Dray's health reaches 0, it will activate the end screen.

Builds for both MacOS and Windows are located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JG_4nS3Wb0L0BRaqcS54ORznGNhD4I-b?usp=drive_link).

## How to Play
To move, you can use either WASD or the arrow keys. To attack enemies, click the Z key and, when the Grappler is active, you can use it by clicking the X key. Dray can also jump forwards or dodge enemies using the space bar and a direction key.
